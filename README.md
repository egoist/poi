Poi is a bundler built on the top of webpack, trying to make developing and bundling apps with webpack as easy as possible.

**The Poi project is supported by our [Backers](./BACKERS.md) and funded through [Patreon](https://patreon.com/egoist).**

## Features

- 📦 Out of box support for JS, CSS, File assets and more.
- ⚛ Framework-agnostic but also support JSX, Vue and more with no configs.
- 🔌 Great extensibility.
- 🐙 Fits most web apps, npm libs.
- 🚨 Great development experience.

## Quick Overview

Before we get started, ensure that you have installed Node.js (>=8) and Yarn (or npm) on your machine.

### Get Started Immediately

```bash
yarn global add create-poi-app
create-poi-app my-app

cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:4000 to see your app.<br>
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.

### Get Started Manually

Inside an empty project, run `yarn init` or `npm init` to create a `package.json` and install Poi:

```bash
yarn init
yarn add poi --dev
```

Now all you need is to create an entry file, like if you're building a website, just create an `index.js`:

```js
const el = document.createElement('div')
el.textContent = 'Hello Poi!'

document.body.appendChild(el)
```

Now if you run:

```bash
yarn poi --serve
```

You will get a URL like `http://localhost:4000` which you can open to preview the app.

Next let's start adding some dependencies like a CSS file `style.module.css`:

```css
.title {
  color: pink;
}
```

```js
import styles from './style.module.css'

const el = document.createElement('div')
el.className = styles.title
el.textContent = 'Hello Poi!'

document.body.appendChild(el)
```

Save it and the browser will automatically reload to apply the changes!
