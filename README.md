## Introduction

Poi is a __zero-config__ bundler built on the top of webpack. By using the buzz word `zero-config`, it does not mean that there's no config, instead we pre-configured many things for you. To prevent Poi from becoming too bloated to use, we also introduced some kind of `plugin` system to make extra features opt-in.

To get a quick taste of Poi, you can install it globally via npm or yarn:

```bash
$ npm i -g poi
# But it's recommended to install it locally for real-world projects.
# i.e. cd your-project && npm i poi -D
```

The `poi` command is somehow similar to `node`, by running `poi` in a directory, it will use `index.js` or the file specified at `main` field in `package.json` as entry file of your application.

```bash
# Use `index.js` or `pkg.main`
$ poi
```

Then your application will be running at `http://localhost:4000`

In most cases, you don't need to configure anything to make your app work with Poi, since Poi has great built-in support for:

- Babel, transform widely used ES next features to ES5, including JSX
- PostCSS, and a bunch of popular CSS pre-processors like Sass
- Vue, no config is required for your Vue applications
- etc..
