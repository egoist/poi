## Introduction

Start writing an app with a single `.js` file, Poi could handle all the development setups for you, no more configuration hell.

Install *Poi*:

```bash
# Either globally
yarn global add poi
# Or locally (preferred)
yarn add poi --dev
```

Then populating an `index.js` and writing with your favorite framework like one of:

<p>
<details><summary>React / Preact</summary><br>

```js
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'

const App = () => <h1>Hello React.</h1>

render(<App />, document.getElementById('app'))
```

Note: You need to install `react` `react-dom` and desired babel preset like `babel-preset-react-app`. For convenience, here's also [poi-preset-react](https://github.com/egoist/poi/tree/master/packages/poi-preset-react) you can use.

It's similar for other React-like framework.
</details>

<details><summary>Vue</summary><br>

```js
import Vue from 'vue'

new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello Vue.</h1>
  }
})
```

Note: You don't need to install any dependencies, `vue` is already brought by `Poi`. And single-file component is also supported by default.
</details>

<details><summary>Other</summary><br>

You can use existing [presets](https://github.com/egoist/poi/tree/master/packages) such as [poi-preset-riot](https://github.com/egoist/poi/tree/master/packages/poi-preset-riot) and [poi-preset-react](https://github.com/egoist/poi/tree/master/packages/poi-preset-react) to configure your framework to work with `Poi`, or contribute another preset for your desired framework.

## Start the server

To develop this file, run `poi` in your terminal and you can open `http://localhost:4000` to preview!

So far we get:

- Automatic transpilation and bundling (with webpack and babel/postcss)
- Hot code reloading
- Static file in `./static/` is served as static files.

Build app in production mode (optimized and minified):

```bash
poi build
```

To change the path of entry file:

```bash
poi src/my-entry.js # development
poi build src/my-entry.js # production
```

## FAQ

<details><summary>How's it different from a boilerplate?</summary><br>

It's hard to upgrade your project if you're using a boilerplate since you might change the code to suit your needs. However you can easily upgrade your project to use latest version of Poi by simply updating the dependency.

You can also get rid of boilerplate code in this way.
</details>

<details><summary>How does Poi manage dependencies for external frameworks?</summary><br>

`Vue` is included, other frameworks need to be installed alongside `Poi` in your project.
